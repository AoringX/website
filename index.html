            <p>I'm a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science Engineering at the University of
                Michigan. Prior to this, I also spent two years studying in the Department of ECE at the University of
                Toronto, which founded my strong knowledge base and experience in software development, digital systems,
                and electrical circuits.</p>
            <p>My academic interest lies in Computer Networks and Artificial Intelligence with a particular focus on
                Machine Learning. Currently, I'm collaborating with Professor You at Fudan University, INC Lab working
                on projects involving NTN RAN development using Open Air Interface.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy exploring advanced algorithms and creating my own websites and applications. I'm
                passionate about pushing the boundaries of technology and am always eager to connect with individuals
                and professionals with shared minds in the tech industry. Feel free to reach out to me!</p>
